A gamified diff generator

!['Diff-cult' repl in action](./demo.gif)

## What is it for

This can be used (and was intended to be used) as a tool to gauge transformation speed
for example, how long it took me to transform A to B in `VSCode` vs `neovim`, use can use this information to see how effective you are in each editor in different tasks, which is better for which - or where you can improve yourself / your environment

this also can be just played as a simple "factory" game, where you can golf the solution or try to get the fastest one
